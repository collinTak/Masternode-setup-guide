Masternode Setup Guide

This guide is for a single masternode, on a Ubuntu 16.04 64bit server (VPS) running headless and will be controlled from the wallet on your local computer (Control wallet). The wallet on the the VPS will be referred to as the Remote wallet.
You will need your server details for progressing through this guide.

First the basic requirements:

12,000 BLTG
A main computer (Your everyday computer) – This will run the control wallet, hold your collateral 12,000 bltg and can be turned on and off without affecting the masternode.
Masternode Server (VPS – The computer that will be on 24/7)
A unique IP address for your VPS / Remote wallet
(For security reasons, you’re are going to need a different IP for each masternode you plan to host)

The basic reasoning for these requirements is that, you get to keep your BLTG in your local wallet and host your masternode remotely, securely.

Configuration
Note: The auto zBLTG minter should be disabled during this setup to prevent auto minting of your masternode collateral. BEFORE unlocking your wallet, you can disable autominting in the control wallet option menu.

1) Using the control wallet, enter the debug console (Tools > Debug console) and type the following command:
masternode genkey (This will be the masternode’s privkey. We’ll use this later…)

2) Using the control wallet still, enter the following command:
getaccountaddress chooseAnyLabelForYourMasternode

3) Still in the control wallet, send 12,000 BLTG to the address you generated in step 2 (Be 100% sure that you entered the address correctly. You can verify this when you paste the address into the “Pay To:” field, the label will auto populate with the name you chose”, also make sure this is exactly 12,000 BLTG; No less, no more.)
– Be absolutely 100% sure that this is copied correctly. And then check it again. We cannot help you, if you send 12,000 BLTG to an incorrect address.

4) Still in the control wallet, enter the command into the console:
masternode outputs
 (This gets the proof of transaction of sending 12,000)

5) Still on the main computer, go into the BLTG data directory, by default in Windows it’ll be
%Appdata%/bltg or the directory you have chosen when installing your wallet
or Linux
~

Find masternode.conf and add the following line to it:

 <Name of Masternode(Use the name you entered earlier for simplicity)> <Unique IP address>:17127 <The result of Step 1> <Result of Step 4> <The number after the long line in Step 4>

Example: MN1 31.14.135.27:17127 892WPpkqbr7sr6Si4fdsfssjjapuFzAXwETCrpPJubnrmU6aKzh c8f4965ea57a68d0e6dd384324dfd28cfbe0c801015b973e7331db8ce018716999 1

Substitute it with your own values and without the “<>”s

VPS - Remote wallet install
First some basics.

Create a Swap File - Low Ram Servers
 sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
 sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
 sudo mkswap /swapfile
 sudo swapon /swapfile
 sudo nano /etc/fstab
 
 Add to fstab file by using arrow down and pasting the following on the file after all that already is there
 
/swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0

once done press CTRL x
press y
press enter  # done
 
Install all the dependencies

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev autoconf pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev automake

sudo apt-get install automake pkg-config bsdmainutils libgmp3-dev -y

sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev -y


sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

sudo apt-get install software-properties-common -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin

press enter

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev

sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev

7) Install the latest version of the BLTG wallet onto your masternode. The lastest version can be found here: https://github.com/Block-Logic-Technology-Group/bltg/releases

Go to your home directory:
cd /home
From your home directory, download the latest version from the BLTG GitHub repository:
 
git clone https://github.com/Block-Logic-Technology-Group/bltg

Go to bltg folder
cd bltg <enter>
./autogen.sh <enter>
./configure <enter>
make <enter>

Note: If this is the first time running the wallet in the VPS, you’ll need to attempt to start the wallet 

cd src/   press enter
./bltgd   press enter
 this will place the config files in your ~/.bltg data directory
press 
CTRL+C
 to exit / stop the wallet then continue to step 8
 

Configuration Cont.
8) Now on the masternodes, find the BLTG data directory here.(Linux: ~/.bltg)
cd ~/.bltg

9) Open the bltg.conf by typing 
vi bltg.conf
 then press i to go into insert mode and make the config look like this:

 rpcuser=long random username
 rpcpassword=longer random password
 rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
 server=1
 daemon=1
 listen=1
 logtimestamps=1
 maxconnections=256
 masternode=1
 externalip=youruniquepublicipaddress:17127
 masternodeprivkey=Result of Step 1
Make sure to replace rpcuser and rpcpassword with your own.

10) to exit the editor press 
esc
 then 
:wq!
 then press enter

Start your masternode
11) Now, you need to finally start these things in this order
- VPS에서 데몬 클라이언트를 시작합니다. 먼저 설치된 wallet 디렉토리로 돌아가서,
cd ~ / bltg
cd /src

다음을 사용하여 지갑을 시작하십시오. 
excute pate = ($ ~bltg/src)
./bltgd

– From the Control wallet debug console
startmasternode alias false <mymnalias>

where <mymnalias> is the name of your masternode alias (without brackets)

The following should appear:
“overall” : “Successfully started 1 masternodes, failed to start 0, total 1”,
“detail” : [
{
“alias” : “<mymnalias>”,
“result” : “successful”,
“error” : “”
}

– Back in the VPS (remote wallet), start the masternode
./bltg-cli startmasternode local false

– A message “masternode successfully started” should appear

12)Use the following command to check status:

./bltg-cli masternode status

You should see something like:

{
“txhash” : “334545645643534534324238908f36ff4456454dfffff51311”,
“outputidx” : 0,
“netaddr” : “45.11.111.111:17127”,
“addr” : “D6fujc45645645445645R7TiCwexx1LA1”,
“status” : 4,
“message” : “Masternode successfully started”
}

Congratulations! You have successfully created your masternode!

Now the masternode setup is complete, you are safe to remove “enablezeromint=0” from the bltg.conf file of the control wallet.

Tearing down a Masternode
1) How do I stop running MN1 on my VPS hoster and delete MN1 from my ‘BLTG Core – Wallet’?

a) ./bltg-cli stop from the masternode to stop the wallet.
b) Then from your controller wallet PC, edit your masternode.conf, delete the MN1 masternode line entry.
c) Now restart the controller wallet.
d) your 12K will now be unlocked.

2) How do I get the 12k back that I’ve send to my MN1 address at the beginning of the MN1 setup?

You don’t need to “get that back” as it is already in your wallet.
Being in the different address is not an issue as that’s also your address.

3) Can I use this 12k normally on my wallet then again, and sell it or stake it normally like before?

Yes!
